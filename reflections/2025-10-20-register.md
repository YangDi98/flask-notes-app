## Feature Name

### 1. What it does
Allow to register a user for this app

### 2. What could go wrong?
- Email is not verified and might not be valid
- Race condition: two requests with same email at the same time could bypass uniqueness check
- Email format: email may not be valid if schema validation is weak.
- Brute force registration: No rate limiting or CAPTCHA allows bots to spam registrations.
- Case sensitivity: Emails like Test@Email.com and test@email.com may be treated as different.
- Need to delete the test users without password and make password column non-nullable.

### 3. Trade-offs / Limitations
- There is no rate limiting or detecting if the user is a bot.
- There is no email confirmation.

### 4. Future Improvements / Scaling Considerations
- Look into race condition.
- Add rate limiting, and add detecing if user is a bot.
- Add email confirmation.
- Can also look into sign up with Google etc.
