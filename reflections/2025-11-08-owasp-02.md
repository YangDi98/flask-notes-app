## Name:
OWASP A02 Reflection

## Details
- In general, OWASP 02 (Cryptographic Failure) is about protecing sensitive data both at rest (stored) and in transit (transferred).
- Unsalted hashing: hash('password') -> always produces the same hash
- Salted hashing : hash('password' + random_salt) -> produces different hash each time
- Always use salted hashing. Flask-Bcrypt includes salting automatically.
- Always store password in hash. Other sensitive data should be encrypted. 

## Future Considerations
- Will look into details of encryption and hashing in the future. 
- **Data in transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Database connections**: Encrypt connection strings and use SSL
- **Sensitive data**: Encrypt when stored (PII, financial data, etc.)
