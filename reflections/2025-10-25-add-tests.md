## Name
Adding tests using pytest

## Key Takeaways:
- I can either use sqlite in memory db, or create a separate db for test (I choose).
- Pytest does not automatically clear up data after tests unless I explicit tell it to do so (by using fixtures).
- yield stops the function (generator) until explicitly advanced (calling next).
- with app.app_context() pushes the app onto Flask's context stack and allows db operations to know which app/config to use. The context is poped when exiting `with` block. 
```
# Without app context - Flask doesn't know WHICH app you mean
db.create_all()  # Error: Which database? Which app?

# With test app context
with test_app.app_context():
    db.create_all()  # "Use the TEST database from my test app!"

# With production app context  
with prod_app.app_context():
    db.create_all()  # "Use the PRODUCTION database from my prod app!"
```
- No need to import fixtures to use them
- pytest does not actually run the app or making http calls when I call endpoints in tests. 
- Measure test coverage `poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html tests/`
